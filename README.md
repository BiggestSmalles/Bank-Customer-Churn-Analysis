# üè¶ Bank Churning Analysis Project

Welcome to my **Bank Churning Analysis** project! This repository showcases my ability to analyze complex datasets, generate actionable insights, and present them in a way that is both visually appealing and technically sound. This project is a demonstration of my skills in data analysis, Python, and Jupyter Notebook. Thank you for viewing my project!

## üìä Project Overview

In this project, I analyze a dataset to understand the factors that contribute to customer churn in a bank. By identifying key drivers behind customer attrition, this analysis can help banks improve customer retention strategies and reduce churn rates.

### Key Questions Addressed

- **Customer Churn Analysis:**
  - What are the primary factors contributing to customer churn?
  - How does customer demographics, account balance, and service usage affect the likelihood of churn?

- **Predictive Modeling:**
  - Can we build a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn?
  - Which machine learning algorithms perform best in predicting churn?

- **Recommendations:**
  - What actionable recommendations can be made to reduce customer churn?
  - How can banks enhance their services to retain valuable customers?

## üõ† Technical Details

This project leverages several powerful tools and techniques:

- **Python:** Extensive use of Python for data cleaning, analysis, and model building. Key libraries include Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** The entire analysis is documented in Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to follow the thought process and reproduce results.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualizations are created to illustrate key findings and model performance, aiding in the interpretation of results.

## üìä Data Summary

- **Total Customers Analyzed:** 10,000+
- **Churn Rate:** 20.4%
- **Key Features Analyzed:** Customer demographics, account information, service usage, and customer satisfaction.

## üìà Key Insights

- **Demographics Impact:** Older customers and those with lower account balances are more likely to churn.
- **Service Usage:** Customers who use fewer bank services are at a higher risk of churning.
- **Model Performance:** The Random Forest algorithm provided the best performance with an accuracy of 85% and an AUC score of 0.90.
